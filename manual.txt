TERRAIN GENERATOR USER MANUAL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mouse:

- Click & Drag: Terrain Rotation
- Scroll: Zoom In & Out

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Menu:

- Detail Slider: Controls the detail level of the NoiseMaps, which adds or
  removes complexity to the scene. The detail controls the side length of the
  square, which is 2^detail + 1. Ranges from 1 - 7.
  
- Smoothness Slider: Controls the level at which the random variation in the
  NoiseMap generation becomes negligable. This results in a terrain that is
  smoother at higher values, and very rough at lower values.
  
- Blending Slider: Controls the smoothness of the NoiseMap generated for
  coloring the terrain.
  
- Generate Terrain Button: When clicked, a new terrain is generated using the
  current detail slider, smoothness and blending values. The controls below
  are only used to modify the scene coloring & shading, they do not change
  the Terrain object in any way.
  
- Amplitude Slider: Stretches the Terrain upwards and downwards, resulting in
  shallow terrains at low values and steep mountains (usually) at higher
  values.

- Breadth Slider: Stretches the Terrain along the x and z axes, causing the 
  Terrain to spread out at higher values and scrunch together at lower values.

- Background Color Sliders: Individual sliders for the Red, Green, and Blue
  components of the background color. Updates without having to generate new
  Terrain.
  
- Ambient Color Sliders: Individual sliders for the Red, Green, and Blue
  components of the ambient lighting added to all faces across the terrain.
  Updates without having to generate new terrain.
  
- Light Color Sliders: Individual sliders for the Red, Green, and Blue
  components of the directional light in the scene, which shines down directly
  from above. The directional light remains stationary (as it is infinitely far
  away) while the user rotates & manipulates the scene.

- Terrain Color 1 Sliders: Individual sliders for the Red, Green, and Blue
  components of high color in the Terrain color map.
  
- Terrain Color 2 Sliders: Individual sliders for the Red, Green, and Blue
  components of low color in the Terrain color map.
  
- Randomize Button: Randomizes the Smoothness & Blending and generates a new
  Terrain. Also chooses a random value for the Amplitude, Breadth, Ambient Color,
  Directional Light Color, Terrain Color 1 and Terrain color 2. When pressed,
  generates a very new and unique environment. Note: Random values may not be
  across entire range of slider (this is intentional - to ensure generally
  good looking environments).

Additional Information:

- For best results, consider high choosing highly contrasting colors for
  Terrain Color 1 & 2.
  
- Consider Ambient Colors where Red, Green & Blue values are rougly equal.

- It may be necessary to zoom in or out when choosing extreme Amplitude or
  Breadth values.
